# LS01D

Within the scope of the laser radar can achieve 8 meters 360 degrees of two-dimensional planar scanning, produce the space plane point cloud information is used to map surveying and mapping, robot autonomous obstacle avoidance applications such as navigation and positioning, intelligent equipment.

LS01D laser radar sampling rate can sweep frequency can be adjusted.The default 10 hz sampling 3600 points per second, scanning frequency, Angle resolution of 1 degree.Sweep frequency can be set up to highest 11 hz, sampling points per second up to 4000 points.

LS01D laser radar, the principle of laser triangulation ranging is adopted, through god radium intelligent team of high frequency image collection and processing system, the default work of measuring frequency is 3600 points per second, users to customize up to 4000 HP/SEC.Every time range in the process, LS01D pulse modulation of the laser emission infrared laser signal and the laser reflected light signal after exposure to the target object, the reflected light through a set of optical lens received by LS01D image collection and processing system.After LS01D of embedded real-time signal processing module, the target object and LS01D radar distance and relative orientation Angle values will be output from the communication interface.
